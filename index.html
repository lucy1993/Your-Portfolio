			<div class="title">SPORTSBOOK TERMINALS UX OPTIMISATION</div>
			<img src="img/terminal/ter1.jpg">
			<div class="p2">Project Background</div>
			<div class="desc2">One of the most interesting projects I have worked on is a betting terminal redesign. Betting terminals are at 			the core of the gambling industry - they are massively popular fixtures across Europe and UK. The unit is a terminal with 			sportsbook inside, making one of the key challenges to design seamless experiences that would address hardware and software 		limitations and mesh with user preferences across regions. Sampling highlighted a number of areas users were reporting 				issues with, which we were tasked with resolving.</div>
			<div class="p2">Goals</div>
			<div class="desc2">Resolve key UX issues reported by betting terminal users <br> <br>

					<b>1.</b> Users were reporting prohibitively slow loading times due to outdated front-end technology. <br> <br>

					<b>2.</b> Users were reporting poor navigation experience. This was due to outdated hardware and overall poor user journey modelling - basically there were a ton of extra steps from start to finish, complicating and prolonging the process. <br><br>
			</div>
			<img src="img/terminal/ter2.jpg">
			<div class="p2">Design Process</div>
			<div class="desc2">The project scope was quite large so I adopted IDEO's "Human-Centered Design and Design Thinking" process:<br><br>

					<b>1.</b> Empathize: Our research team conducted a thorough research with solid analyses, and we had a large body of existing feedback from users, so this stage was fairly cut-and-dry. <br><br>

					<b>2.</b> Define: I outlined two main issues to address - uncomfortable UX with wonky site navigation; and technological limitations. <br><br>

					<b>3.</b> Ideate: Time to start sketching! I had a couple of potential solutions in mind so I created a couple of Lo-Fi UI sketches. The solution we decided to explore was a simple, 1 page experience (as opposed to the current 4 pages). I then collaborated closely with front-end engineers to bring the solution to life. <br><br>

					<b>4.</b> Prototype: I pivoted to Photoshop for the next step, and produced the first Hi-Fi mockups. Many of our users reported that they could not distinguish between clickable and non-clickable elements of the page, so I took a simpler approach. First drawing from flat design which was growing in popularity in 2014, I eventually opted for a skeuomorphic style which would ensure ease-of-use for users. <br><br>

					<b>5.</b> Validate: We conducted tests both in-house and by recruiting existing users. Data collected was reported feedback and observed user behavior. Initial feedback was very positive, and our stakeholders were onboard with our proposed solution with only minor tweaks. <br><br>
			</div>

			<div class="p2">Product development stage</div>
			<div class="desc2">
					Now we were ready to start development! Our team employed Agile methodology for this project (as we typically did for all projects). I worked very closely with the development team to ensure the quality of the final product. We found a challenging phase was speed testing, which was also one of the most important UX issues to resolve. We began by setting up 2 terminals in our office - one of the best performing and one of the worst. We then applied our solution to both. Unsurprisingly, we found that newer machines performed much better than the outdated ones. Next, we needed to find an optimal solution that would work on both older and newer terminals. Months of testing and optimizing solutions culminated in a single marketable solution. Ongoing work after this included replacing the outdated machines on the client side, and ongoing updates and patches for our team.

			<div class="p2">Results</div>
			<div class="desc2">
					We conducted a user survey alongside the launch of our solution. We quickly learned that we had essentially solved all of the main pain-points for users with the new version. The majority of users preferred the new, one-page interface and updated design and UI. A few users preferred the original design, but the vast majority were both happier with the interaction and getting through the process faster. <br><br>

					Initial numbers were all very positive (although exact figures are confidential). We noticed a large jump in use for the first 3 months, and further fine-tuned the product based on feedback collected. <br><br>

					To sum up, we were tasked to create a product that would stand out in the industry. By employing a user-based approach, we were able to deliver a product that embodies the latest in design and technology to create compelling user experiences. The gaming terminals are now the industry standard, renowned for both security, reliability and ease-of-use. <br><br>
